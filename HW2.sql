/*THE REASONING BEHIND MY CODE*/
/*

I do my MSQL files like this because I like to know the steps I took to modify this file.
I am not an expert, I am only a student and I need to be able to see what I did in order to retain my knowledge.
My reasoning for the PYTHON FILE was based off Donovan's examples; I also learned from other resources.
I also felt as if other examples were too difficult, especially when modifying the MYSQL tables from Python,
so I decided to make it shorter and CLEANER.


In terms of this:

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON gym_db.* TO 'root'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

I had to do it this way, because VSC wouldn't connect with MySQL Workbench. That is the reason behind that.
